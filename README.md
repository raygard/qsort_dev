# qsort_dev

A set of improved C standard library `qsort` routines, with benchmark/test code.

See my [posts](https://www.raygard.net/2022/01/17/Re-engineering-a-qsort-part-1/) for more info.

This code is licensed 0BSD, so free for any purpose.

I believe these sort functions to be correct, but I would be grateful for any feedback about errors or anything else.
